fdf is a 42 school project.

The object was to create a simple line drawing program using the minilibx graphics library. The program reads the graphics input "map" from a textile.

Each digit is a point in the map that we draw a line from to a next point. The value of the digit is the vertical height of the point, which can be both negative and positive.

Its also possible to add a color code to the input file that dictates the color of the line.
